I've got something to tell you
Don't wanna make you sad

I've got something to tell you
Don't wanna make you mad

We've been together for so long
Don't wanna break your heart

We've been together for so long
I gotta get smart

I've got something to tell you
Don't wanna cause a scene

I've got something to tell you
I know it sounds mean

We've been together for so long
I hate to break your heart

We've been together for so long
I gotta get smart

I'm done, I'm done thinking it over
I know we said, we'd give it a try
It hurts now but deep down inside,
We both know it's better to part
Than live in a lie

So.
Go on, go on, go on, go on
Go on, go on, go on, go on
Go on, go on, go on, go on
Go on, go on, go on, go on

Go on, go on, go on, go on
(I gotta get smart)
Go on, go on, go on, go on
Go on, go on, go on, go on
(I gotta get smart)
Go on, go on, go on, go on
Go on, go on, go on, go on
(I gotta get smart)
Go on, go on, go on, go on
Go on, go on, go on, go on
Go on, go on, go on, go on
Go on, go on, go on, go on
(I gotta get smart)

Go on, go on, go on, go on...
